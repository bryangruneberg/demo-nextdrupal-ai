Used in Asian cooking, these can be purchased dried and rehydrated for a strong, deep flavor. Or buy fresh and add to soups and stir-fries. Not only does this mushroom have an intense flavor, it looks lovely too. The deep brown and smooth shapes will provide texture to your meal. In their dried form and rehydrated, these are the perfect addition for a deep and flavorful stock for a risotto.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe gorgeous sunny \u003Cstrong\u003Echanterelle\u003C\/strong\u003E with its yellow flesh has a fruity flavor - but it is worth mentioning that there are many lookalikes out there and care should be taken to ensure you\u0027re eating the right ones. These look great in an omelette or an Asian soup to complement the yellow tones.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe brown \u003Cstrong\u003Emorel\u003C\/strong\u003E offers a meaty and distinctive flavor and you\u0027ll probably love how extraordinary they look in a meal. The morel is a more popular mushroom during the spring, when their availability is high.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor delicacy try the \u003Cstrong\u003Eenoki\u003C\/strong\u003E with its tiny white heads that grow in a bunch. These can even be eaten raw in salads. Finally, you can choose the popular \u003Cstrong\u003Eoyster\u003C\/strong\u003E mushroom. They are named thus because they look nothing like a mushroom and resemble the innards of an oyster and their sweet flavor is delicious.\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
